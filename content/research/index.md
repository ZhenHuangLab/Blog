## Research Interest

* Biological physics, Biological chemistry, Structural Biology
* cryo-EM/ET, membrane protein analysis *in situ*, methodology and computation
* Combination of various methods such as SPA and cryo-ET to achieve high-resolution visualization of flexible regions, macromolecules, dynamic protein complexes, and even whole cell *in situ*
* Cellular level molecular interaction landscape, Molecular Sociology

To understand why I am interested in fields such as biology, structural biology, and cryo-electron microscopy, please refer to this [post](../posts/research-interest/).
