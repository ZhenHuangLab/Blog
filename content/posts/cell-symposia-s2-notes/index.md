## synaptic signaling complex organization: phase separation

*Mingjie Zhang, Southern University of Science and Technology*

neurons take compartmentalization to the extreme

PSD: postsynaptic density

**liquid-liquid phase separation**: a new look of cellular compartments/organelles

regulated fusion and fission of the membraneless organelles

phosphorylation-dependent

CaMKII-mediated fusion of the two PSDs

super-resolution imaging mearsuring the distance between two PSDs(upper and lower layers)

## Bacterial flagellar motor

*Yongqun Zhu, ZJU*

bidirectional rotary machine, CCW always means forward? CW means tumbling

C ring-free flagellar motor

intact, C ring-contained bacterial flagellar motors

does the purification process affect the structure of the intact motor?

## cryo-ET reveals sarcomere structures at molecular resolution

*Stefan Raunser, Max Planck Institude of Molecular Physiology, Germany*

structure of the skeletal muscle sarcomere(the force-generating machine)

the actin cytosekeleton

myosin is a ATPase

Troponin and tropomyosin regulate atmomyosin interaction

high resolution actin-tropomyosin complex structure, water molecule

water relocation during the G- to F-actin transition

Nemaline myopathy linked N11S-actin releases Pi instantly

cryo-FIB-SEM-cryo-ET workflow: automated batch cryo-lamella milling

Mouse skeletal myofibril imaged using cryo-ET

typical cross-bridge with a myosin double-head

nebulin: Molecular ruler, its structure, the conserved site stands out

Thin filament components

Myosin - Titin - MyBP-C in molecular detail

## Chaperonin and human group II chaperonin TRiC(CCT)

*Wah Chiu, Stanford University, USA*

high resolution structure of Archael Chaperonin(MmCpn)

MmCpn in low ATP concentration

each MmCpn complex has distinct structural model

Folding intermediate

**for one paticularly protein, there exists only one folding pathway?**

## Selective Autophagy

*Sascha Martens, University of Vienna, Wien, Austria*

De novo formation of an organelle

cellular homeostasis and tissue remodeling

Atg9 vesicle

membrane binding by Faa1

## post-translational translocation

*Long Li, PKU School of Life Science*

SecA ATPase, convert the energy of ATP hydrolysis into polypeptide movements

The alternation of the interaction strength of clamp

## WeiTsing, ion channel

*Yuhang Chen, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, CAS*

two immune responses against pathogen invasion: PTI and ETI

NLR resistosome & WeiTsing channel

Clubroot disease, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae(Pb), is a devastating soil-borne disease of Brassica crops worldwide

Identification of C6 as the causal gene of clubroot resistance

C6 is specifically expressed in the pericycle upon Pb infection

C6 restricts the colonization of Pb into stele

WeiTsing protein forms a novel pentameric architecture

WTS forms a $Ca^{2+}$-permeable cation-selective channel, which is essential for triggering $[Ca^{2+}]_{cyt}$ increase and immune defense in plants
