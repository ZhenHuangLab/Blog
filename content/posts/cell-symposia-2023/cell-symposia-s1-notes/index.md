## GCGR
*Beili Wu, Shanghai Institude of Materia Medica, CAS*

conformational changes of the stalk

structure determination of the GCGR -G protein, Gs and Gi

G protein binding specificity

arrestin-mediated mudulation: tail & core

GPCR-arrestin structure

GCGR-$\beta$arr1 structures adopt a tail conformation

tail conformation is largely distinct from the core conformation

Helix VIII in GCGR-arrestin has a major role in the arrestin recruitment

phospholipid stabilizes the tail engagement

tail conformation mediates cellular trafficking of GCGR and is involved in endosomal G-protein signaling

### keypoints
* Structures of the full-length GCGR in four different conformational states were solved
* The stalk and ECL1 are involved in modulating peptide ligand binding and receptor activation
* Intracellular loops play a critical role in determining G protein selectivity
* The tail engagement of GCGR-arrestin mediates cellular trafficking and endosomal G-protein signaling


## mGlus: class C GPCRs
*Beili Wu, Shanghai Institude of Materia Medica, CAS*

Dimerization is mandatory for the function of mGlus

homo and hetermodimers

structure determination of homodimers

inter-subunit conformational changes upon activation

asymmetric dimerization of mGlus is important for receptor activation

class A & B: helix VI activate

structure determination of heterodimers

mGlu3 VFT plays a dominant role in mGlu2-mGlu3 signaling

Asymmetric signal transduction of mGlu2-mGlu3, using mutations

Asymmetric signal transduction of mGlu2-mGlu4

### summary
* The cryo-EM structures of mGlu homo- and heterodimers in different conformational states were determined.
* The G-protein-binding site in mGlus, which is mainly formed by the intracellular loops, is distinct from those in all the other GPCR structures
* Asymmetric dimerization is crucial for receptor activation and many provide a molecular basis for the asymmetric signal transduction of mGlus
* Stability of the inactive conformation and G protein interaction pattern of the subunits are determinants of asymmetric signal transduction of the mGlu heterodimers
