## Initial Foray into Scientific Research

In fact, before I became familiar with structural biology, which was in the autumn and winter of my sophomore year (Fall and Winter of 2021), I joined [Jie Dong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0020164)'s lab for a period of scientific research. At that time, I had absolutely no concept of scientific research; I found Jie Dong because I wanted to participate in the National Undergraduate Life Science Competition, and I was particularly interested in gene editing and protein-protein interaction networks. The project I participated in at the time was about protein purification and antibody preparation, so during that period, I learned a lot of wet lab techniques, such as operating bacterial shakers, extracting proteins, running nucleic acid electrophoresis/protein electrophoresis, and performing Western Blots, etc. I would like to express my special thanks to Jie Dong for giving me the opportunity to get started in scientific research.

## Exposure to Cryo-Electron Microscopy

Also in the autumn and winter of 2021, I became particularly interested in astrophotography. By chance, I came across an [introductory video on cryo-electron microscopy by Grant Jensen](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV143411k7KJ/?vd_source=8853cef8ebf91279c71e0d6cbaab17a9) on Bilibili; I was attracted to it and clicked in to watch. Afterwards, it got out of control: I gradually began to realize that cryo-electron microscopy research was very in line with the biological research I aspired to, and it also had a peculiar fit with my hobbies at the time. So after learning more about cryo-electron microscopy research, around May of my sophomore spring and summer (i.e., around May 2022), I tried to contact [Professor Xing Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/xingzhangccem), the director of the Cryo-Electron Microscopy Center at Zhejiang University. Here, I would also like to express my special thanks to Professor Zhang for giving me such a great opportunity. During the interview, Professor Zhang invited [Yunjie Chang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yunjiechang) to join us, and asked me if I was interested in cryo-ET. At that time, I actually hadn’t heard much about cryo-ET, only about SPA, but I heard that cryo-ET had higher computational requirements, and could solve structures in situ, which I found amazing at the time, so I wanted to give it a try. So I officially joined Professor Xing Zhang’s lab, and under the guidance of Yunjie Chang, I learned and practiced cryo-electron microscopy related scientific research.

In the following time, I became familiar with the use of various data processing software for cryo-electron microscopy, such as IMOD, EMAN2, and Relion. Then I also learned about the data collection process, and helped write some Python scripts, such as scripts to improve the data collection efficiency of PACE-tomo. I suddenly discovered that I was actually quite suited for computational work, and I could also be very focused on such projects, often immersing myself in coding for an entire afternoon without moving. And at that time, I also received encouragement from Yunjie Chang and Professor Zhang, feeling that I was kind of quite talented in this area, so I was also greatly encouraged, forming a "positive feedback" in my understanding of cryo-electron microscopy. Of course, in this process, there were also many difficulties to overcome; I needed to self-learn Linux, self-learn MATLAB, equivalent to making up for a lot of basic knowledge in computer science, but looking back now, it all seems not a big problem.

## Decision to Study Abroad and Participation in Overseas Projects

An interesting thing is that both Jie Dong and Yunjie Chang returned from Yale University. Although it sounds very silly now, I was actually quite fascinated by Yale University when I was in high school. Plus, Chang recommended that I study abroad, and all these factors combined, I decided to go abroad for my PhD to extend my worldview. So in the autumn and winter of my junior year (around November 2022), I signed up to participate in the Imperial College London Data Science Winter School. Although it was turned online due to the pandemic, I still hoped to experience the feeling of studying abroad in advance, and by the way, to see if I was suitable for studying abroad. Another reason for signing up for this program was that, whether for my hobbies(astrophotography) or for scientific research(cryo-EM), a profound understanding of images and image processing was very necessary, and seeing that this program had a computer vision related project (i.e., brain tumor segmentation based on neural network), I tried to sign up. During the course, I learned more about neural networks and image segmentation; during the project, I was mainly responsible for the coding. It turned out that I might have some talent in this area, at least our results won the Best Computer Vision Project award. Through this exchange and study, I indeed gained a deeper understanding of image processing and CNN.

In the spring and summer of my junior year (around April this year), I also participated in the  international exchange course in the Department of Computer Science, which was also about machine learning and artificial intelligence. The lecturer was a professor from Brown University, and I scored 94 points, which was a pretty good grade. Then actually, I also learned Stanford CS231n and UMich EECS 498-007/598-005 on YouTube, taught by Justin Johnson, which were very detailed.

Of course, during this period, I also continued to develop methods related to cryo-ET resolution of membrane proteins under the guidance of Chang, such as methods for picking particles, and so on.

## Going to Kai lab in Yale for Summer Intern

I contacted [Kai Zhang](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jack-zhang/?tab=bio) at Yale in March, and I was very happy that he quickly agreed, and here I also want to express my special thanks to Kai for his help. In the Kai Lab, I mainly worked on the development of new methods for getting high-resolution structure of membrane protein *in situ*, and most of my time was still spent on computation and coding. I practiced a lot of numerical and analytical methods for image processing. (btw, later when paper is published, I can talk about the details inside, so stay tuned.)

What's more, I participated in many lectures and conferences, which helped me learn much more about cryo-EM and beyond. For example, I listened in on MB&B 420a/720a(Macromolecular Structure and Biophysical Analysis) given by [Joe Howard](https://howardlab.yale.edu/people/joe-howard); and listened the lecture *The impact of cryoEM in structural biology* given by [Richard Henderson](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/h-to-m/richard-henderson/), who was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and *Innovation by Evolution: Bringing New Chemistry to Life* by [Frances Arnold](http://fhalab.caltech.edu/), who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. I even attended the Dean's Invited Speaker Series held by Yale Engineering, where I listened C.C.Wei, the CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor, talking about his Ph.D. life in Yale. In a nut shell, the experience in Yale is pretty unforgettable.
