## A Few Words Before...

I have been extremely instereted in Astronomy since I was 9 years old. I was so impressed by total lunar eclipse that occurred on December 10, 2011. Following that extraordinary event, I have read lots of different kinds of popular science books about astronomy. By October 2021, my interest had pivoted towards astrophotography, a passion that eventually influenced my decision to pursue cryo-EM in my research endeavors.

Astrophotography and cryogenic electron microscopy actually have much in common:

* **The targets are always very dim.** As for astrophotography, especially deep sky imaging, the surface brightness of nebulae and galaxies is exceptionally low. In the case of cryo-EM, the electron dose is very low in order to protect the organic sample from potential damage.
* To get high-quality image and see more details of the object, **averaging images** is essential in both fields as it effectively reduces noise and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ensuring a crisper, more detailed visualization.
* Data (or image) collection in both realms demands meticulous **correction of any drifts**. Mechanical errors can critically compromise the imaging of the region of interest (ROI) in both astrophotography and cryo-EM. So, the importance of a stable mount and a precise guiding system in astrophotography cannot be overstated.
